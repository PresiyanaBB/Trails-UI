# Welcome to the frontend part of Trails 👋

## Description

Trails is a personal project that showcases various locations across Bulgaria where artists have created public artworks, such as graffiti and mosaics. The project was developed to encourage artists to contribute to making their cities more vibrant and enjoyable places to live.

People feel better when they see beautiful artwork on building walls, rather than the typical, monotonous facades reminiscent of the communist era. This is precisely our mission — to inspire positive emotions and attract visitors to experience the beauty of our amazing country.

This is the user interface of Trails. Here, you can view the Artists and Projects tables, access our contact information, and navigate through the index page. You can also add new artists and projects to the platform.
